* Process
    * Foreground Process - process that requires a user to start them and interact with them.
    * Background Process - process that runs in the background without user interaction. 

* Process Attribute
    * UID - User ID of the user who started the process.
    * PID - Process ID.
    * PPID - Parent Process ID.
    * TTY - Terminal associated with the process.
    * CMD - Command that started the process.
    * STIME - Start time of the process.    
    * TIME - Total time the process has been running.
    * C - CPU utilization of the process.

* `pwd &` - run a command in the background.
* `ps` - list all the processes.
    * `ps 1234` - list the process with the given PID.
    * `ps -f` - list all the processes with full details.
    * `ps -A` `ps -e`- list all the processes with extended information.
    * `ps -x` - list all the processes for current user.
    * `ps -fU myUser` - list all the processes for a given user.
    * `ps -fG myGroup` - list all the processes for a given group.
    * `kill 1234` - kill the process with the given PID.

* Linux Scheduler
    1. Preemptive Scheduler - Scheduler that can interrupt a process and allocate the CPU to another process.
    2. Non-Preemptive Scheduler - Scheduler that cannot interrupt a process and allocate the CPU to another process.

* Short Job First(SJF)
